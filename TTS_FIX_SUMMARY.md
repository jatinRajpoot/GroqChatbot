# TTS Feature - Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

The TTS feature was failing with HTTP 500 errors because:

1. **Wrong API Method**: Initially tried to use `client.audio.speech.create()` which doesn't exist in Groq Python SDK v0.11.0
   - The SDK only supports `client.audio.transcriptions` (Whisper STT)
   - TTS is not yet implemented in the Python SDK

2. **Terms Acceptance Required**: Groq requires explicit terms acceptance for PlayAI TTS models
   - Error: `The model playai-tts requires terms acceptance`
   - This is a one-time setup per Groq account/organization

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Direct HTTP API Integration
Updated `groq_client.py` to use `httpx` for direct API calls:
```python
url = 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/speech'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
payload = {
    'model': model,
    'voice': voice,
    'input': text,
    'response_format': response_format
}
response = httpx.Client().post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detects "terms acceptance" errors
- Returns HTTP 403 with `error_type: 'terms_required'`
- Provides direct link to accept terms

### 3. User-Friendly Frontend Messages
JavaScript shows clear alert with:
- What went wrong
- Where to fix it (link to Groq console)
- That it's a one-time setup

## What You Need to Do üéØ

### Accept PlayAI TTS Terms (One-Time Setup)

**For English Voices:**
1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/playground?model=playai-tts
2. Log in with your Groq account
3. Click to accept the terms of service
4. Done! Refresh your chatbot

**For Arabic Voices (Optional):**
1. Visit: https://console.groq.com/playground?model=playai-tts-arabic
2. Accept the terms
3. Refresh your chatbot

## Testing the Fix

After accepting terms:

1. **Test the speaker button** on any AI message
2. **Should hear audio** with Fritz voice (default)
3. **Try different voices** from the dropdown
4. **Check error handling** - should get helpful messages if issues occur

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Backend API | ‚úÖ Working | Using httpx for HTTP calls |
| Frontend UI | ‚úÖ Working | 23 voices available |
| Error Handling | ‚úÖ Working | Clear messages for users |
| Terms Acceptance | ‚è≥ Pending | **You need to accept terms** |
| Audio Playback | ‚è≥ Pending | Will work after terms accepted |

## Files Changed

1. **groq_client.py**
   - Added `import httpx`
   - Rewrote `text_to_speech()` to use direct HTTP API
   - Better error handling with detailed messages

2. **app.py**
   - Enhanced `/api/tts` endpoint error handling
   - Detects terms acceptance errors
   - Returns proper HTTP status codes

3. **static/js/app.js**
   - Improved error message parsing
   - User-friendly alert for terms requirement
   - Better error recovery

## Documentation Created

1. **TTS_SETUP_REQUIRED.md** - Setup instructions
2. **TTS_README.md** - Complete feature documentation
3. **TTS_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Next Steps

After you accept the terms:

1. ‚úÖ Refresh your browser (http://localhost:5000)
2. ‚úÖ Click any speaker button
3. ‚úÖ Hear the AI response in audio!
4. ‚úÖ Try different voices from the dropdown

## Alternative Options

If you can't accept terms immediately, I can:

1. **Add Browser TTS Fallback**
   - Uses system voices (free, offline)
   - Lower quality but works immediately
   - No Groq API needed

2. **Disable TTS Temporarily**
   - Hide speaker buttons
   - Re-enable after terms accepted

3. **Wait for Terms**
   - Current implementation ready
   - Just needs your one-time acceptance

**Which would you prefer?**

## Error Messages You Might See

### Before Terms Acceptance
```
‚ö†Ô∏è TTS Setup Required

TTS requires terms acceptance. Please visit 
https://console.groq.com/playground?model=playai-tts 
to accept terms.

This is a one-time setup. After accepting terms, refresh this page.
```

### After Terms Accepted
- ‚úÖ Audio plays successfully
- ‚úÖ Speaker button pulses during playback
- ‚úÖ All 23 voices work

## Technical Details

### Why Direct HTTP API?
- Groq Python SDK (v0.11.0) doesn't include TTS yet
- OpenAI-compatible API available via HTTP
- httpx already installed (used by Groq SDK)

### API Endpoint
```
POST https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/speech
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "playai-tts",
  "voice": "Fritz-PlayAI",
  "input": "Text to convert to speech",
  "response_format": "wav"
}
```

### Response
- Content-Type: `audio/wav`
- Binary audio data (WAV format)
- Directly playable in HTML5 Audio element

## Rate Limits

- Same as other Groq API calls
- Check your account limits at https://console.groq.com/settings/limits
- TTS may have separate quota

**The fix is complete! Just accept the terms and you're ready to go! üéâ**
